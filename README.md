# BluetoothXPlatformChat
A cross platform demonstration of Bluetooth messaging between PC and mobile phone using following NuGets and Xamarin Forms.

InTheHand.Net.Bluetooth, and;
MvvmLight

I put this together while trying to understand the ins and outs of using bluetooth to communicate between an Android mobile phone and a PC.

The solution is made up of the following projects:

 <b>BluetoothXPlatformChat</b>
 The device agnostic Xamarin Forms project.

 <b>BluetoothXPlatformChat.Common</b>
 A class library with shared classes for all platforms

 <b>BluetoothXPlatformChat.Android</b>
 The Android App. A simple two tab app one for send and one for receive.
 
 <b>BluetoothXPlatformChat.iOS</b>
 This would be the iOS app but at the time of writing it has not been started (no iPhone to test it on, feel free to email me if you have one to donate!)
 
 <b>BluetoothXPlatformChat.WPF</b>
 The WPF desktop chat app.
